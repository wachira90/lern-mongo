For MongoDB version 4.4.17 on Linux, you can enhance both performance and security by following some best practices. Here’s a breakdown of recommended steps:

### 1. **Install MongoDB Securely**
   - Use MongoDB’s official repository to ensure you're getting verified packages.
   - Update your system packages before installing MongoDB.

     ```bash
     sudo apt update && sudo apt install mongodb-org
     ```

### 2. **Enable Authentication**
   - By default, MongoDB does not enforce authentication. Enable it to protect your database.

     In the MongoDB configuration file (`/etc/mongod.conf`), enable authorization:

     ```yaml
     security:
       authorization: enabled
     ```

   - Restart MongoDB to apply changes:

     ```bash
     sudo systemctl restart mongod
     ```

   - Create an admin user for authentication:

     ```bash
     mongo
     use admin
     db.createUser({
       user: "adminUser",
       pwd: "your_secure_password",
       roles: [{ role: "root", db: "admin" }]
     })
     ```

### 3. **Use Strong Authentication Mechanisms**
   - Prefer SCRAM-SHA-256 for authentication, as it’s the most secure supported mechanism in MongoDB.

### 4. **Restrict Network Access**
   - Limit MongoDB’s network exposure by binding it only to localhost or internal network IPs.

     Edit `mongod.conf`:

     ```yaml
     net:
       bindIp: 127.0.0.1
     ```

   - Use a firewall (e.g., `ufw` or `iptables`) to allow access only from trusted IPs:

     ```bash
     sudo ufw allow from <trusted_ip> to any port 27017
     ```

### 5. **Enable TLS/SSL for Secure Connections**
   - Configure TLS/SSL in `mongod.conf`:

     ```yaml
     net:
       ssl:
         mode: requireSSL
         PEMKeyFile: /path/to/your/server.pem
     ```

   - Use a valid, signed certificate for production environments to prevent interception of traffic.

### 6. **Enforce Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
   - Limit database user permissions to only what's necessary, and avoid granting root access.

     For example, for a user who needs to read data only:

     ```bash
     db.createUser({
       user: "readUser",
       pwd: "secure_password",
       roles: [{ role: "read", db: "your_database" }]
     })
     ```

### 7. **Set Up Data Encryption at Rest**
   - Enable data-at-rest encryption for sensitive data storage:

     ```yaml
     security:
       enableEncryption: true
       encryptionKeyFile: /path/to/your/keyfile
     ```

   - Create a 96-byte key file and set secure permissions on it:

     ```bash
     openssl rand -base64 756 > /path/to/your/keyfile
     chmod 600 /path/to/your/keyfile
     ```

### 8. **Enable Logging and Monitoring**
   - Enable the logging of all actions for auditing and monitoring in `mongod.conf`:

     ```yaml
     systemLog:
       destination: file
       logAppend: true
       path: /var/log/mongodb/mongod.log
       logRotate: reopen
     ```

   - Use MongoDB Cloud Manager, Ops Manager, or an ELK stack for advanced monitoring.

### 9. **Regular Backups**
   - Schedule regular backups with `mongodump` or MongoDB’s backup services to prevent data loss.

### 10. **Disable HTTP Status Interface**
   - Disable the HTTP status interface unless you explicitly need it:

     ```yaml
     net:
       http:
         enabled: false
     ```

### 11. **Update MongoDB Regularly**
   - Regularly check for MongoDB updates and apply patches to address security vulnerabilities.

Following these steps will create a secure, production-ready MongoDB environment on Linux. Let me know if you need details on any specific configuration!
